# Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains implementations of neural networks for image classification tasks, along with the **final Week 4 Brain Tumor classification project (Colab)**.
It also includes Week 2 experiments using basic NN and MLP architectures on FashionMNIST.

##  Week 4 Brain Tumor Project

The final notebook (Week 4) is hosted on **Google Colab**.
ðŸ‘‰ [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YusRiQP43xSQG458nMQcHbBD6MWsvndY#scrollTo=Jrg4MfOjQKDQ)

If you want to include it directly in this repo:

1. Open the notebook in Colab.
2. `File â†’ Download .ipynb`.
3. Add the `.ipynb` file to this repo and commit it.
